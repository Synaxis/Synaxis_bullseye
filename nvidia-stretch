sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository contrib
sudo add-apt-repository non-free
sudo apt update

Now it's time to blacklist the nouveau driver, to avoid possible conflicts:

sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nouveau.conf

And inside the file we put the following:

blacklist nouveau
blacklist lbm-nouveau
options nouveau modeset=0
alias nouveau off
alias lbm-nouveau off

We close and save with Ctrl + O and Ctrl + X.

Now Install the nvidia-driver package using the following command:

sudo apt install nvidia-driver

During installation you will see the following message, just hit Enter to continue.

xserver-xorg-config-nvidia

In case any error occurs during the installation of the package on the system, you will need to install the driver from the stretch-backports repository.
